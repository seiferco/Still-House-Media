# Still House Media SEO & Ad Revenue Strategy

## 1. What is Programmatic SEO?
Programmatic SEO is a method of creating hundreds of high-quality landing pages automatically by combining a template with a database of variables. Instead of writing one article at a time, you write **one template** and generate **many pages** targeting specific, long-tail keywords.

### How it applies to Still House Media:
You can capture traffic from hosts searching for solutions in their specific city or for their specific property type.

**Examples:**
- "Direct Booking Website for **Crystal River** Hosts"
- "Direct Booking Website for **Austin** Hosts"
- "Direct Booking Website for **Beach House** Owners"
- "Direct Booking Website for **Cabin** Owners"

## 2. Implementation Plan

### Step A: The "Local Dominance" Strategy (City Pages)
Create a template page: `/solutions/vacation-rental-website-builder-{city}`.
- **Title:** "The Best Direct Booking Website Builder for {City} Hosts"
- **Content:**
  - "Are you an Airbnb host in {City}?"
  - "Hosts in {City} pay an average of 15% in fees."
  - "See how much {City} hosts are saving with Still House Media."
  - **Interactive Element:** Embed the "Middleman Tax" calculator pre-filled with average rental income for that city.

### Step B: The "Platform Alternative" Strategy
Create pages targeting dissatisfied users of specific platforms.
- "Best Alternative to **Lodgify** for Small Hosts"
- "Cheaper Alternative to **OwnerRez**"
- "Direct Booking vs **Airbnb** Calculator"

### Step C: The "Host Education" Blog (Manual Content)
Write high-value articles that answer specific questions. This builds authority.
1.  "How to collect emails from your Airbnb guests (legally)"
2.  "The legal guide to direct booking contracts"
3.  "How to market your vacation rental on Facebook"

## 3. Running Ads on These Pages (Monetization)
Yes, you can run ads, but **be careful**. Your primary goal is to sell YOUR service ($199/mo + setup). Running Google Ads (AdSense) might earn you pennies while distracting a user who might have paid you thousands.

### Recommended "Ads" (Affiliate Marketing)
Instead of random Google Ads, place **strategic affiliate links** for products your hosts need. You earn a commission (referral fee) without distracting them from the main goal.

**Top Affiliate Programs for You:**
1.  **Insurance:** Proper Insurance or Waivo (Vacation rental damage protection).
2.  **Smart Locks:** Yale or Schlage Encode (Essential for self check-in).
3.  **Dynamic Pricing:** PriceLabs or Wheelhouse.
4.  **Cleaning Software:** Turno (formerly TurnoverBnB).

**Where to place them:**
- "We recommend **PriceLabs** for dynamic pricing – [Link]" inside your setup guide.
- "Secure your direct bookings with **Superhog** – [Link]" on your features page.

## 4. Next Steps for Execution
1.  **Keyword Research:** Use a tool like Ahrefs or Ubersuggest to find which cities have high search volume for "vacation rental management" or "airbnb host help".
2.  **Create the Template:** I can help you build a `LandingPageTemplate.jsx` that accepts `city` or `niche` as a prop.
3.  **Launch:** Start with 5-10 major vacation rental markets (e.g., Kissimmee, Destin, Gatlinburg, Scottsdale, Myrtle Beach).
